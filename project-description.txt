This is the landing page for the Natours project. 
The website is built with HTML5 / CSS3 / SASS / BEM Architecture.
In this project I demonstrate the power of these technologies by
following best practices as far as web development is concerned.

NOTES for how background images url work with sass.

1. Important to point out that 
   We must specify urls just ONE level up as if we were at main.scss
   because when imported urls will resolve from main.scss and not individual files.

2. Inline elements behave like text no matter what tag we put inside be it an img, span and so on.

3. Define a mixin for box-shadows
4. Write media queries for popup window.
5. Make responsive HTML images for popup and stories with density and resolution technique.
5. Make responsive CSS background images.
